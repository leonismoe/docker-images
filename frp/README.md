[frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.
